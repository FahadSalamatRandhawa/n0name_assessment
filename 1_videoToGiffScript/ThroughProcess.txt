Initially the approach I had was this

Video --> SlicedGif
SlicedGif --> Watermarked git

Later I changed my method because to put watermark on gif, each frame would need to be processed individually. Which would consume more resources and time.
New approach

Video --> SlicedVideo
SlicedVideo ---> Watermaked Gif


used async/await for streamlined processing since it is not an api
